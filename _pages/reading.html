Hello!  My name is Nari (rhymes with "Atari") and I'm a Harvard College student graduating in Spring 2021.  I am currently pursuing a joint Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science.

My research interests broadly include machine learning and theoretical computer science.  I'm especially interested in machine interpretability and machine learning for healthcare.  I currently do machine learning research advised by Prof. Finale Doshi-Velez in Harvard's [Data to Actionable Knowledge lab](https://dtak.github.io/).
