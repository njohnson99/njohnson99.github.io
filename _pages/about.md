Hello! My name is Nari (rhymes with "Atari") and I am a second year PhD student in Carnegie Mellon University's Machine Learning Department advised by [Ameet Talwalkar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~atalwalk/).  I graduated from Harvard in 2021 with a BA and MS in Computer Science, where I am grateful to have worked with [Finale Doshi-Velez](https://dtak.github.io).<br/>

My research studies methods to help humans understand and evaluate machine learning models.  I am currently interested in tools to help stakeholders discover and fix systemic model errors (such as reliance on spurious features). <br/>

Service
------
I care deeply about expanding access to and creating supportive communities in computing.  At CMU, I participate in the AI Mentorship Program and [TechNights](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/technights/).

In a past life, I served as elected Co-President of [Harvard Women in Computer Science](https://www.harvardwics.com/) and led our Advocacy Council, where I facilitated Harvard CS's first [inclusive teaching training](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/10/7/cs-tf-training/).  I also volunteered as a trained counselor for [Indigo Peer Counseling](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/17/Indigo-peer-counseling/).
