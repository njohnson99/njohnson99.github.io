Hello! My name is Nari (rhymes with "Atari") and I am a first-year PhD student in Carnegie Mellon University's Machine Learning Department advised by [Ameet Talwalkar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~atalwalk/).  I graduated from Harvard in May 2021 with a BA and MSc in Computer Science.<br/>

My research studies methods to help humans understand, evaluate, and audit machine learning models.  More broadly, I am interested in interpretability and explainability, human-AI interaction, and methods that can help discover or mitigate systemic failure modes of ML models. <br/>
