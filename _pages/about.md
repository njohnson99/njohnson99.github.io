Hello! My name is Nari (rhymes with "Atari") and I am a first-year PhD student in Carnegie Mellon University's Machine Learning Department advised by [Ameet Talwalkar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~atalwalk/).  I graduated from Harvard in May 2021 with a BA and MSc in Computer Science.<br/>

I am broadly interested in interpretability, explainability, and human-AI interaction.  I study methods to help humans understand, audit, and use machine learning models.<br/>
