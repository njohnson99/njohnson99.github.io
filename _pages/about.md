Hello!  My name is Nari (rhymes with "Atari") and I'm a Harvard College student graduating in Spring 2021.  I am currently pursuing a joint Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science.  

My research interests broadly include machine learning and theoretical computer science.  I'm especially interested in building models that fulfill desiderata such as robustness and transparency in high-stakes domains.  I currently work with Prof. Finale Doshi-Velez in Harvard's [Data to Actionable Knowledge lab](https://dtak.github.io/).
